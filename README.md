gitclone
========
 
###Project to organize GIT/Gist tools I use beginning with git repo cloner currently clone5.sh
main purpose of the cloner is to clone multiple repos at the user or org level. this can quite easily be large thatn the available storage on the destination machine on even a single use. Additionally in some cases the settings for how much data to pull should be adjusted based on the permissions of your account in relation to the API limit for calls daily. getparserepos is good for a quick snapshot, if you know the user you are shopping, otherwise blindly going in starting with find tools, then isolating projeects or users, then again for the clone process be prepared to jump on a vpn to swap ips, or a ssh cloudserver, and also changing out user id's. if its a consistent issue you are looking up a shocking ratio of prodcutive repo authors/curators generally the first 100 listings will not fill up unless you are looking at busy web people like googles html5 projects including polymer, chrome, html5rocks, google, etc. also twitter and yelp are quite large and hopefully microsoft will be someday very soon as well. i dont really mean that. 

####Actually it would be nice to see apple here since the elitists of the open source movement those leading the charge all seem to favor apple, who to my knowlege runs on a versino of linux but closed like sony's, and they are a nice product to be sure, but ridiculously overpriced, an arrogant status simble at worst, and totally closed source and catching no flack. bit of a double standard there methinks!
